# movie_recomendation_system

<h1>🎬 Content-Based Movie Recommendation System</h1>
This project implements a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies similar to a user's preferences by analyzing various features of movies such as genres, directors, cast, and plot summaries. Unlike collaborative filtering, this system doesn't rely on user interactions but focuses solely on the content attributes of movies to generate recommendations.​
